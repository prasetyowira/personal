# Documentation and Commenting Rules

## Core Principles

- Documentation should be clear and concise
- Keep documentation close to the code it describes
- Update documentation when code changes
- Focus on explaining "why" more than "how"

## README Files

- Every project must have a root README.md
- Keep READMEs up to date with current project state
- Include:
  - Project purpose and scope
  - Setup instructions
  - Development workflow
  - Key architectural decisions
  - Links to other relevant documentation

## Code Comments

- Write brief, clear comments
- Focus on explaining why, not what
- Keep comments up to date with code
- Remove commented-out code
- Use JSDoc for public APIs and interfaces

## Plans and Progress

- Keep active development plans in `/plans`
- Use plans as working notebooks
- Document both successes and failures
- Track changes in approach
- Cross-reference related documents

## Plan Structure

- Clear problem statement
- Current state description
- Implementation steps
- Challenges and solutions
- Progress tracking
- References to related code
