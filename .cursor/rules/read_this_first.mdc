## Quick Reference

CRITICAL: Before making any changes:
- Work incrementally - one small change at a time
- Verify each change before proceeding
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- When in doubt, check the detailed rules

## Engineering Approach

Our development process emphasizes:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Proper testing and verification
- Reliable CI/CD practices
- Incremental, verified changes

### Development Technique

We work piece by piece. ALWAYS:
1. Make one focused change at a time
2. Verify it works before proceeding
3. Document what you've done
4. Clean up any temporary changes

It is imperative to avoid trying to accomplish several things in one go. Change one thing, verify it works, test if need be and then change the next thing.

## Core Principles

1. **Clean Code Organization**
   - Small, focused files
   - Clear naming conventions
   - Minimal, careful modifications

2. **Living Documentation**
   - Document plans and progress
   - Keep documentation updated

## Project Planning

Active development plans and progress tracking are maintained in the `/plans` directory. This is a working area that evolves with the project, containing:
- Current development plans
- Debugging sessions
- Progress tracking
- Investigation notes

# Core Instructions For AI

IMPORTANT:
1. ALWAYS check relevant rule files before making changes
2. Work incrementally - one small change at a time
3. Verify each change before proceeding
4. Keep documentation and plans updated
5. When in doubt, ask for clarification
6. Make sure you understand the full context before proceeding

Remember: From a clean restart, these rules and the plans should tell you everything you need to know about where to pick up.
