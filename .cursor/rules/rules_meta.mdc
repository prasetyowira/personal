# Meta Rules

## Purpose

These rules define how to maintain and grow the cursorrules system. They ensure our development guidelines remain useful, current, and manageable.

## Core Principles

- Keep rules minimal but effective
- Rules should solve real problems
- Update rules based on experience
- Remove rules that aren't helping

## Rule Organization

- Each rule file has a specific focus
- Rules should not duplicate across files
- Keep related guidance together
- Use clear, consistent formatting

## Maintaining Rules

- Update rules when practices change
- Remove outdated guidance
- Add new rules based on lessons learned
- Keep examples current and relevant

## When to Add Rules

Add new rules when:
- A pattern emerges in development
- We encounter recurring issues
- We find better ways of working
- Current rules are insufficient

## When to Remove Rules

Remove rules when:
- They're no longer relevant
- They're causing friction
- They're commonly ignored
- Better approaches exist

## Rule Format

- Use clear, direct language
- Include practical examples
- Explain the "why" behind rules
- Keep formatting consistent
