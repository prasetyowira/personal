# Docker and CI Rules

## Core Guidelines

- Each service should have a clear, single responsibility
- Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size
- Ensure consistent environment variables across all environments
- Add health checks for all services
- Wait for dependent services before starting
- Use production builds in CI/CD pipelines
